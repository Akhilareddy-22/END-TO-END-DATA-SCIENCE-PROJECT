PROJECT OVERVIEW
# DATA SCIENCE PROJECT: House Price Prediction Project
This project focuses on building an End-to-End Data Science solution, covering the complete lifecycle of a data science application from data collection and preprocessing to model development and deployment. The main goal is to demonstrate how a machine learning model can be transformed into a real-world usable application through an API or web interface using Flask or FastAPI.
In this project, raw data is first collected from reliable sources and then cleaned, processed, and explored using Python data science libraries. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to understand data patterns, relationships, and potential issues such as missing values or outliers. Based on this analysis, appropriate feature engineering and preprocessing techniques are applied to prepare the data for model training.
A machine learning model is then developed using suitable algorithms depending on the problem type (classification or regression). The model is trained, evaluated, and optimized using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or RMSE. Visualization techniques are used to interpret the model’s behavior and performance.
After building the model, it is deployed using Flask or FastAPI to create a REST API or web application. This allows users to input data and receive predictions in real time. The deployment step demonstrates how machine learning models are integrated into real applications used by businesses.
This project highlights real-world industry practices where data science is not limited to model training but also includes deployment and usability. It provides hands-on experience in full-stack data science workflow and prepares interns for professional data science roles.
Overall, this project bridges the gap between theoretical machine learning concepts and real-world application development, making it a complete and practical data science solution.
